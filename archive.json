      "body": "The document currently defines three concrete hybrid KEMs.  All of these hybrid KEMs are based on ML-KEM, and all of them use the QSF generic framework.\n\nOn the one hand, it could be helpful to define additional concrete hybrid KEMs to demonstrate when the other frameworks would be preferred.  For example:\n\n* A X25519 + Classic McEleice combination, for use in an environment where public keys are reused, would provide a case where PRE is clearly superior to GHP, since Classic McEliece does not have C2PRI, but does have giant public keys.\n* An RSA-OAEP + HQC combination would show the need for GHP, since RSA-OAEP is not a nominal group, and HQC does not have C2PRI resistance, but HQC keys are not big enough for pre-hashing to provide a significant advantage.\n\nOn the other hand, we should not create concrete hybrid KEMs that nobody is going to use.  If there is not a requirement by applications for all of the frameworks in the generic document, we could remove any frameworks that are not needed.\n",

It's relevant to the security of the whole scheme and it'd be unfortunate if the KDF named got used for the PRG function unnecessarily (it's probably not a cryptographic strength issue but it's definitely an interop and protocol confusion issue)\r\n\r\nAlso (_hello welcome to the bikeshed paint shop_) maybe PQ before T, left to right? It aligns with the order left-to-right when constructing the actual KDF preimages and it signals the PQ part first which is the primary objective of the these constructions (achieve quantum security while belt and suspenders'ing with traditional fallback) ",
