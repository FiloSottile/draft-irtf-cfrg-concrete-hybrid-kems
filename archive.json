      "body": "The document currently defines three concrete hybrid KEMs.  All of these hybrid KEMs are based on ML-KEM, and all of them use the QSF generic framework.\n\nOn the one hand, it could be helpful to define additional concrete hybrid KEMs to demonstrate when the other frameworks would be preferred.  For example:\n\n* A X25519 + Classic McEleice combination, for use in an environment where public keys are reused, would provide a case where PRE is clearly superior to GHP, since Classic McEliece does not have C2PRI, but does have giant public keys.\n* An RSA-OAEP + HQC combination would show the need for GHP, since RSA-OAEP is not a nominal group, and HQC does not have C2PRI resistance, but HQC keys are not big enough for pre-hashing to provide a significant advantage.\n\nOn the other hand, we should not create concrete hybrid KEMs that nobody is going to use.  If there is not a requirement by applications for all of the frameworks in the generic document, we could remove any frameworks that are not needed.\n",

I may be pickled by the recent reviews on hybrid-signature-spectrums against the flow chart vibe but\r\n\r\nYes, I concur that there isn't a logical basis for this pathway. I like the idea of a flowchart, but this one does not account for the decision variables. My concern is also that there isn't a research basis for this. There are claims of one performing better or security being good enough, but not a breakdown or backing for those claims.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to take the bullet list that is at the start of the commit, and build out the logic that goes into each item in the list. E.g., if the claim is one is more efficient than the others, there should be a citation for that claim. If we are going to say the security fits the needs, then a list of security properties and why the selection is made that seems to fit most needs.",

We could provide some numbers to back this up in an appendix if you want, as we did [with SFrame](https://rfcs.online/rfcs/rfc9605.html#name-overhead-analysis).  But that wouldn't be rigorous, and in any case, it's not going to get done by the I-D deadline.\r\n\r\nI agree we should be sharper on the security trade-offs.  I was thinking that that would mainly get captured in the generic doc, since these are properties of the frameworks.\r\n\r\nThe flow-chart / guide here isn't meant to be normative (you MUST do this).  It's meant to guide people toward the right solutions.  If there are other considerations, by all means take them into account.
