--- abstract

PQ/T Hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) combine "post-quantum"
cryptographic algorithms, which are safe from attack by a quantum computer,
with "traditional" algorithms, which are not.  CFRG has developed a general
framework for creating hybrid KEMs.  In this document, we define concrete
instantiations of this framework to illustrate certain properties of the
framework and simplify implementors' choices.

# Introduction

PQ/T Hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) combine "post-quantum"
cryptographic algorithms, which are safe from attack by a quantum computer,
with "traditional" algorithms, which are not.  Such KEMs are secure against a
quantum attacker as long as the PQ algorithm is secure, and remain secure
against traditional attackers even if the PQ algorithm is not secure.

{{!HYBRID-KEMS=I-D.irtf-cfrg-hybrid-kems}} defines a general framework for
creating hybrid KEMs. It includes multiple specific mechanisms for combining
a PQ algorithm with a traditional algorithm, with different performance
properties and security requirements for the underlying algorithms.

In this document, we describe instances of these different specific
combiners, with specific choices for the underlying algorithms.  The choices
described here illustrate the security analysis required to make choices that
meet the requirements of the general framework, and can serve as a baseline
for application designers.  We also provide test vectors for these instances
so that implementors can verify the correctness of their implementations.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

We make extensive use of the terminology in {{HYBRID-KEMS}}.

# Concrete Nominal Group and KEM Instances

This document introduces concrete hybrid KEM instances that in turn depend on
concrete KEM and nominal group instances. This section introduces the nominal
groups and KEM instances used for concrete hybrid KEM instances, specified in
line with the abstraction from {{HYBRID-KEMS}}. {{nominal-groups}} defines
the concrete nominal groups, and {{nominal-kems}} defines the nominal KEMs.

## Nominal Groups {#nominal-groups}

This section specifies concrete nominal groups that implement the abstraction
in {{HYBRID-KEMS}}. It includes groups based on the NIST curves P-256 and
P-384, as well as a group based on Curve25519.

### P-256 and P-384 Nominal Groups {#group-nist}

The NIST P-256 and P-384 elliptic curves are defined in {{SP800-186}}.  They are
widely used for key agreement and digital signature.  In this section, we define
how they meet the Nominal Group interface described in {{HYBRID-KEMS}}.

Group elements are elliptic curve points, represented as byte strings in the
compressed representation defined by the Elliptic-Curve-Point-to-Octet-String
function in {{SEC1}}.

The Nominal Group algorithms are the same for both groups:

- `Exp(p, x) -> q`: This function computes scalar multiplication between the
  input element (or point) `p` and the scalar `x`, according to the group law
  for the curve specified in {{SP800-186}}.
- `RandomScalar(seed) -> k`: Implemented by converting `seed` to an integer
  using the Octet-String-to-Integer function in {{SEC1}}, and then reducing the
  resulting integer modulo the group order.
- `ElementToSharedSecret(p) -> ss`: The shared secret is the X coordinate of the
  elliptic curve point `p`, encoded as an `Nss`-byte string using the
  Field-Element-to-Octet-String function in {{SEC1}}.

The group constants for the P-256 group are as follows:

- `Nseed`: 48
- `Nscalar`: 32
- `Nelem`: 33
- `Nss`: 32

The group constants for the P-384 group are as follows:

- `Nseed`: 72
- `Nscalar`: 48
- `Nelem`: 49
- `Nss`: 48

### Curve25519 Nominal Group {#group-curve25519}

The following functions for the Curve25519 nominal group are defined:

- `Exp(p, x) -> q`: Implemented by X25519(x, p) from {{!RFC7748}}.
- `RandomScalar(seed) -> k`: Implemented by sampling and outputting 32 random
  bytes from a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.
- `ElementToSharedSecret(p) -> ss`: Implemented by the identity function,
  i.e., by outputting P.

The following constants are also defined.

- `Nseed`: 32
- `Nscalar`: 32
- `Nelem`: 32
- `Nss`: 32

## Concrete KEM Instances {#nominal-kems}

This section specifies concrete KEM instances that implement the KEM
abstraction from {{HYBRID-KEMS}}.

### ML-KEM-768 and ML-KEM-1024 {#mlkem}

The ML-KEM-768 and ML-KEM-1024 KEMs are defined in {{FIPS203}}.  The algorithms
defined in that specification map to the KEM abstraction in {{HYBRID-KEMS}} as
follows:

- `GenerateKeyPair() -> (ek, dk)`: Implemented as KeyGen in Section 7.1 of
  {{FIPS203}}.
- `DeriveKeyPair(seed) -> (ek, dk)`: Implemented as
  KeyGen_internal(seed[0:32], seed[32:64]), where KeyGen_internal is defined
  in Section 6 of {{FIPS203}}.
- `Encaps(ek) -> (ct, ss)`: Implemented as Encaps in Section 7.2 of
  {{FIPS203}}.
- `Decaps(dk, ct) -> ss`: Implemented as Encaps in Section 7.3 of
  {{FIPS203}}.

The KEM constants for ML-KEM-768 are as follows:

- `Nseed`: 64
- `Nek`: 1216
- `Ndk`: 32
- `Nct`: 1120
- `Nss`: 32

The KEM constants for ML-KEM-1024 are as follows:

- `Nseed`: 64
- `Nek`: 1629
- `Ndk`: 32
- `Nct`: 1629
- `Nss`: 32

<!-- TODO: We need to define how SHA3 functions meet the PRG/KDF interfaces,
though this should be trivial -->

# Concrete Hybrid KEM Instances

This section instantiates the following concrete KEMs:

<!-- TODO: update names; what about these 'qsf-p256'-like names? -->

QSF-P256-MLKEM-SHA3:
: A hybrid KEM composing ML-KEM-768 and P-256 using the QSF scheme, with
  SHA3-256 as the KDF and SHAKE256 as the PRG.

QSF-X25519-MLKEM-SHA3:
: A hybrid KEM composing ML-KEM-768 and Curve25519 using
  the QSF scheme, with SHA3-256 as the KDF and SHAKE256 as the PRG. This
  construction is identical to X-Wing {{XWING-SPEC}}.

QSF-P384-MLKEM-SHA3:
: A hybrid KEM composing ML-KEM-1024 and P-384 using the QSF scheme, with
  SHA3-256 as the KDF and SHAKE256 as the PRG.

Each instance specifies the PQ and traditional KEMs being combined, the
combiner construction from {{HYBRID-KEMS}}, the `label` to use for domain
separation in the combiner function, as well as the PRG and KDF functions to
use throughout.

## `QSF-P256-MLKEM-SHA3` {#qsf-p256}

This hybrid KEM is heavily based on {{XWING}}, using the QSF combiner from
{{HYBRID-KEMS}}. In particular, it has the same exact design but uses P-256
instead of X25519 as the the traditional component of the algorithm. It has
the following parameters.

* Group_T: P-256 {{group-nist}}
* KEM_PQ: ML-KEM-768 {{mlkem}}
* PRG: SHAKE-256 {{FIPS202}}
* KDF: SHA3-256 {{FIPS202}}
* Label: `QSF-P256-MLKEM-SHA3`

The KEM constants for the resulting hybrid KEM are as follows:

- `Nseed`: 32
- `Nek`: 1217
- `Ndk`: 32
- `Nct`: 1121
- `Nss`: 32

## `QSF-X25519-MLKEM-SHA3` {#xwing}

This hybrid KEM is identical to X-Wing {{XWING-SPEC}}. It has the following
parameters.

* Group_T: Curve25519 {{group-curve25519}}
* KEM_PQ: ML-KEM-768 {{mlkem}}
* PRG: SHAKE-256 {{FIPS202}}
* KDF: SHA3-256 {{FIPS202}}
* Label: `\.//^\`

(This label does not follow the same pattern as the other KEMs here, but was
chosen for compatibility with the X-Wing specification.)

The following constants for the hybrid KEM are also defined:

- `Nseed`: 32
- `Nek`: 1216
- `Ndk`: 32
- `Nct`: 1120
- `Nss`: 32

## QSF-P384-MLKEM-SHA3 {#qsf-p384}

QSF-P384-MLKEM-SHA3 has the following parameters:

* Group_T: P-384 {{group-nist}}
* KEM_PQ: ML-KEM-1024 {{mlkem}}
* PRG: SHAKE-256 {{FIPS202}}
* KDF: HKDF-SHA-256 {{!RFC5869}}
* Label: `QSF-P384-MLKEM-SHA3`

The following constants for the hybrid KEM are also defined:

- `Nseed`: 32
- `Nek`: 1629
- `Ndk`: 32
- `Nct`: 1629
- `Nss`: 32

### Security properties

The inlined DH-KEM is instantiated over the elliptic curve group P-384: as
shown in {{CDM23}}, this gives the traditional KEM maximum binding
properties (MAL-BIND-K-CT, MAL-BIND-K-PK).

ML-KEM-1024 as standardized in {{FIPS203}}, when using the 64-byte seed key
format as is here, provides MAL-BIND-K-CT security and LEAK-BIND-K-PK
security, as demonstrated in {{SCHMIEG2024}}.

Therefore this concrete instance provides MAL-BIND-K-PK and MAL-BIND-K-CT
security. <!-- TODO: update XWING paper to show this -->

This implies via {{KSMW2024}} that this instance also satisfies

- MAL-BIND-K,CT-PK
- MAL-BIND-K,PK-CT
- LEAK-BIND-K-PK
- LEAK-BIND-K-CT
- LEAK-BIND-K,CT-PK
- LEAK-BIND-K,PK-CT
- HON-BIND-K-PK
- HON-BIND-K-CT
- HON-BIND-K,CT-PK
- HON-BIND-K,PK-CT
