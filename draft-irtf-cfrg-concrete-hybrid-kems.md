--- abstract

PQ/T Hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) combine "post-quantum" cryptographic
algorithms, which are safe from attack by a quantum computer, with "traditional"
algorithms, which are not.  CFRG has developed a general framework for creating
hybrid KEMs.  In this document, we define concrete instantiations of this
framework to illustrate certain properties of the framework and simplify
implementors' choices.

# Introduction

PQ/T Hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) combine "post-quantum" cryptographic
algorithms, which are safe from attack by a quantum computer, with "traditional"
algorithms, which are not.  Such KEMs are secure against a quantum attacker as
long as the PQ algorithm is secure, and remain secure against traditional
attackers even if the PQ algorithm is not secure.

{{!HYBRID-KEMS=I-D.irtf-cfrg-hybrid-kems}} defines a general framework for creating hybrid
KEMs. It includes multiple specific mechanisms for combining a PQ algorithm with
a traditional algorithm, with different performance properties and security
requirements for the underlying algorithms.

In this document, we describe instances of these different specific combiners,
with specific choices for the underlying algorithms.  The choices described here
illustrate the security analysis required to make choices that meet the
requirements of the general framework, and can serve as a baseline for
application designers.  We also provide test vectors for these instances so that
implementors can verify the correctness of their implementations.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

We make extensive use of the terminology in {{HYBRID-KEMS}}.

# Concrete Nominal Group and KEM Instances

This document introduces concrete hybrid KEM instances that in turn depend on
concrete KEM and nominal group instances. This section introduces the nominal
groups and KEM instances used for concrete hybrid KEM instances, specified in
line with the abstraction from {{HYBRID-KEMS}}. {{nominal-groups}} defines
the concrete nominal groups, and {{nominal-kems}} defines the nominal KEMs.

## Nominal Groups {#nominal-groups}

This section specifies concrete nominal groups that implement the abstraction
in {{HYBRID-KEMS}}. It includes groups based on the NIST curves P-256 and P-384 {{FIPS186}},
as well as a group based on Curve25519 from {{!RFC7748}}

### P-256 Nominal Group {#group-p256}

The following functions for the P-256 nominal group are defined:

- `Exp(p, x) -> q`: This function computes scalar multiplication between
  the input element (or point) `p` and the scalar `x` {{FIPS186}}.
- `RandomScalar(seed) -> k`: Implemented by converting `seed` to an integer using
  OS2IP, and then reducing the resulting integer modulo the group order.
- `ElementToSharedSecret(P) -> ss`: Implemented using the compressed
  Elliptic-Curve-Point-to-Octet-String method according to {{SEC1}} with input `P`,
  yielding a Nelem-byte output. Additionally, this function validates that the
  input element is not the group identity element. Finally, this function outputs the
  encoding the X coordinate of the elliptic curve point corresponding to P to a
  little-endian Nss-byte string.

The following constants are also defined.

- `Nseed`: 48
- `Nscalar`: 32
- `Nelem`: 33
- `Nss`: 32

### P-384 Nominal Group {#group-p384}

The following functions for the P-384 nominal group are defined:

- `Exp(p, x) -> q`: This function computes scalar multiplication between
  the input element (or point) `p` and the scalar `x` {{FIPS186}}.
- `RandomScalar(seed) -> k`: Implemented by converting `seed` to an integer using
  OS2IP, and then reducing the resulting integer modulo the group order.
- `ElementToSharedSecret(P) -> ss`: Implemented using the compressed
  Elliptic-Curve-Point-to-Octet-String method according to {{SEC1}} with input `P`,
  yielding a Nelem-byte output. Additionally, this function validates that the
  input element is not the group identity element. Finally, this function outputs the
  encoding the X coordinate of the elliptic curve point corresponding to P to a
  little-endian Nss-byte string.

The following constants are also defined.

- `Nseed`: 72
- `Nscalar`: 48
- `Nelem`: 48
- `Nss`: 32

### Curve25519 Nominal Group {#group-curve25519}

The following functions for the Curve25519 nominal group are defined:

- `Exp(p, x) -> q`: Implemented by X25519(x, p) from {{RFC7748}}.
- `RandomScalar(seed) -> k`: Implemented by sampling and outputting 32 random bytes
  from a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.
- `ElementToSharedSecret(P) -> ss`: Implemented by the identity function, i.e., by outputting P.

The following constants are also defined.

- `Nseed`: 32
- `Nscalar`: 32
- `Nelem`: 32
- `Nss`: 32

## Concrete KEM Instances {#nominal-kems}

the following functions:

- `GenerateKeyPair() -> (ek, dk)`: Implemented as KeyGen in Section 7.1 of {{FIPS203}}.

# Concrete Hybrid KEM Instances

This section instantiates three concrete KEMs:

<!-- TODO: update names to use Expand/Combine/whatever instead of XOF/KDF/old combiner names -->

1. `HNN3` {{qsf-p256}}:
   A hybrid KEM composing ML-KEM-768 and P-256 using the HashTraditionalOnly combiner with
   SHA3-256 as the Combine KDF and SHAKE256 as the Expand KDF.
1. `HNX` {{xwing}}:
   A hybrid KEM composing ML-KEM-768 and Curve25519 using the HashTraditionalOnly combiner with
   SHA3-256 as the Combine KDF and SHAKE256 as the Expand KDF. This variant is identical to X-Wing {{XWING-SPEC}}.
1. `HNN5` {{qsf-p384}}:
   A hybrid KEM composing ML-KEM-1024 and P-384 using the HashTraditionalOnly combiner with
   SHA3-256 as the Combine KDF and SHAKE256 as the Expand KDF.

Each instance specifies the PQ and traditional KEMs being combined, the
combiner construction from {{HYBRID-KEMS}}, the `label` to use for domain
separation in the combiner function, as well as the XOF and KDF functions to
use throughout.

## `HNN3` {#qsf-p256}

This hybrid KEM is heavily based on {{XWING}}, using the HashTraditionalOnly combiner

following parameters.

    ek_T = Group_T.ToEncaps(dk_T)
    ek_PQ = KEM_PQ.ToEncaps(dk_PQ)

    ss_T = Group_T.ElementToSharedSecret(Group_T.Exp(ct_T, dk_T))
    ss_PQ = KEM_PQ.Decap(dk_PQ, ct_PQ)

    ss_H = Combine(concat(ss_PQ, ss_T, ct_T, ek_T, Label))
    return ss_H

### Security properties

The inlined DH-KEM is instantiated over the elliptic curve group P-384: as
shown in {{CDM23}}, this gives the traditional KEM maximum binding
properties (MAL-BIND-K-CT, MAL-BIND-K-PK).

ML-KEM-1024 as standardized in {{FIPS203}}, when using the 64-byte seed key
format as is here, provides MAL-BIND-K-CT security and LEAK-BIND-K-PK
security, as demonstrated in {{SCHMIEG2024}}.

Therefore this concrete instance provides MAL-BIND-K-PK and MAL-BIND-K-CT
security. <!-- TODO: update XWING paper to show this -->

This implies via {{KSMW2024}} that this instance also satisfies

- MAL-BIND-K,CT-PK
- MAL-BIND-K,PK-CT
- LEAK-BIND-K-PK
- LEAK-BIND-K-CT
- LEAK-BIND-K,CT-PK
- LEAK-BIND-K,PK-CT
- HON-BIND-K-PK
- HON-BIND-K-CT
- HON-BIND-K,CT-PK
- HON-BIND-K,PK-CT
